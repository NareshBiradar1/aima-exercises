The statement "Surely animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent—they can do only what their constituent atoms are told to do by the laws of physics" presents a deterministic view of the universe. Let's break it down and analyze it.

### Determinism and the Laws of Physics

The latter part of the statement argues that all entities, whether living or non-living, operate strictly according to the laws of physics. This viewpoint aligns with the principle of determinism, which suggests that all events in the universe, including thoughts and actions, are determined by previously existing causes. According to this perspective, the behavior of atoms and molecules in a computer, an animal, or a human is governed by physical laws.

### Intelligence and Determinism

The notion that intelligence is incompatible with determinism is not necessarily valid. Intelligence can be understood as the ability to process information, learn, adapt, and solve problems. These processes can, in principle, be fully consistent with deterministic laws. Here’s why:

1.  **Emergent Properties**: Intelligence can be considered an emergent property, arising from complex interactions of simpler components (atoms and molecules). Just because the behavior of these components is deterministic does not negate the emergence of higher-level properties such as intelligence.
    
2.  **Complexity and Organization**: The organization and complexity of a system play a crucial role in its capabilities. For example, the human brain, composed of neurons interacting in highly complex ways, can exhibit intelligent behavior even if each neuron operates according to deterministic physical laws.
    
3.  **Information Processing**: Computers, which are clearly designed and understood to operate according to the laws of physics, can perform tasks that require a level of "intelligence," such as playing chess or recognizing faces. This shows that intelligence, as an information-processing capability, can emerge from systems governed by physical laws.
    

### Implication of the Deterministic View

The statement does not imply that animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent. Instead, it implies that intelligence, whether biological or artificial, operates within the framework of physical laws. The deterministic nature of physical laws does not preclude the existence of intelligent behavior; it merely explains how such behavior arises from the interactions of simpler components.

### Conclusion

The deterministic view presented in the latter statement is true in the sense that all physical processes, including those underlying intelligence, are governed by physical laws. However, this does not imply that animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent. Intelligence can emerge from the complex interactions of simpler components, even if those components themselves are governed by deterministic physical laws. Therefore, the former part of the statement, claiming that animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent, is not a necessary consequence of the latter part.
